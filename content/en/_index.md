## A digital security course

**Attention: This is not a course like many others!**
The digital security course (or "security awareness") that you are about to start will allow you to find out what are the correct behaviors to keep to **manage information securely**.

### What do we mean by security?
By information security we mean:

- **confidentiality** - access to information must be guaranteed only to those who are entitled;
- **integrity** - the information must be preserved intact and complete;
- **availability** - the information must be accessible to those who are entitled to it.

While security technologies (Antivirus, Firewall, IPS) help you protect information (on your computer, smartphone or PC in the office), training is essential on the other: statistics reveal that about **80 percent of cyber incidents are due to human error!**
Unfortunately the error is always around the corner, therefore the risks due to the behavior of people cannot be eliminated completely. But, raising awareness about cyber security can **help "reduce the attack surface"** and be able to better manage your information, both at home and at work.

In other words: **you are the most important link for data protection** and information. Are you ready to become a computer security superhero?
