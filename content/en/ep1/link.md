Any type of document you print could always contain some "sensitive" content: phone numbers, email addresses or other personal data, notes, numbers, email exchanges, amounts related to payments, or even **confidential information**. When you print documents, always remember:

- Check for any sensitive content.
- Do not leave them unattended for example on your desk.
- Do not throw them in the trash before destroying them.
- Take care to keep them in a safe place even when you are at home.
- Do not leave them in the printer.
- Never create unauthorized copies of confidential documents.


In particular at the end of a working day it is important:

- Put the documents in a safe place (for example: closed locker).
- Destroy the documents no longer used, possibly keeping track (log) of what was destroyed, if required.
- Lock the screen every time you leave your workstation, setting a password for reactivation.
- Turn off your computer before leaving the office.
- In case you work with the laptop, turn it off before taking it with you (don't just close it, or set it to "sleep" or "hibernate".
- Do not record confidential information, such as passwords, on slips of paper or post-it notes, leaving them on your desk or attached to the wall of your office or on the monitor.
- Keep the USB pen drives carefully, if necessary under lock and key, always remembering what kind of documents are stored inside them.
