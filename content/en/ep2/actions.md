When you manage credentials to access any service (your email, your office computer or any software) always remember:

- **Never pass on the password**, even to family members. Passwords are always strictly personal.
- Never give any smart card access to information systems to anyone
- **Do not disclose to third parties**, or "impromptu operators", access codes, pins or credentials. The technical staff can carry out checks and checks only after prior agreement with the user and the company and following a request for documented technical intervention.
- Do not use any password automatically generated by the system when you sign up for a service or platform, but - if possible - change the password on first access.
- When choosing a password, **do not use personal data** such as: date of birth, names of relatives, family, friends, animals, social security number, VAT number and so on.
- Choose complex passwords, of at least **8 characters** and which contain upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.
- Periodically change the access passwords: a good rule is to change every password at least every 6 months.
- Safely store access credentials, avoiding storing them on sheets of paper, paper documents or files stored within the workstation.
- Choose unique passwords: avoid using the same password for other users, sites, apps or services.
