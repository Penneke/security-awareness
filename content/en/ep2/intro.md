## Introduction

Also in this episode we deal with a **human error**: in this case a simple naivety that can happen to everyone, but that can also have serious consequences in terms of data and information security. In the episode we find out what can happen if **you do not adequately protect the password that allows access to your computer, your email or even the management system of the institution or company for which you work. Fortunately in this story there is the intervention of a new character ready to "put a piece" ... really super!**
