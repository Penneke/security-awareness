Does it seem incredible what you read? Yet to create this story **we were inspired by a true story**: malicious people contacted the employee of a public body by telephone, posing as technicians, and managed to get passwords to access a database, from which they stole sensitive information and data.

For this you have to keep in mind the recommendation of the technician Giovanni, and **to handle with the maximum care all your passwords**, above all if they give access to some programs or the computer systems where sensitive data are found.
