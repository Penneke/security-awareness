When you receive an email:

- Always pay the utmost attention, check that the e-mail is authentic, look carefully at who the sender is and think twice before clicking on any links.
- Do not disclose personal or business information in an email or respond to email requests for such information.
- Before sending or entering sensitive information online, check the truthfulness and security of the website. Pay attention to the URL of the website. Malicious websites may appear to be identical to a legitimate site, but the URL may use a variation of the spelling (for example "comunedimangialarencia.it") or a different domain (for example a replica of the original site, but which uses ". net "instead of" .com ".net).
- If you are not sure whether an e-mail request is legitimate, try to verify it by contacting the sending company directly, through the usual contacts.
- If the email seems suspicious to you, contact the internal group that deals with computer security, to ask for information or report the suspicious email.
