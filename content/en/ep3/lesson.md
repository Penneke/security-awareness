Does it seem incredible what you read? And yet this type of threat is very frequent and sometimes well masked, and a user's error can have serious consequences for companies and public administrations.

What would have happened if the employee of our history had followed the link of the email, entered the fake site (completely resembling the Municipality's management) and entered his login credentials?
Mr. Malinitenzionati, the creator of everything, would have obtained the credentials of Francesco to access the management of the Municipality, and could thus have obtained all the sensitive data of the citizens. Sensitive data that could be of various nature (addresses, telephone numbers, perhaps the income situation) and that could be used for many unlawful purposes.
