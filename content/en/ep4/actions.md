As always the best protection is prevention!
Here are some simple rules and precautions to be implemented:

- Always keep the computer systems used (operating system, work software, browser, etc.) up to date
- Install and keep your antivirus updated
- Perform periodic, frequent and automatic backups of your files on an external device (USB stick and / or hard disk)
- Never open files, or email attachments, of dubious origin or with "exotic" extensions that you do not recognize. If in doubt, ask the sender if that email is actually authentic and / or perform a scan with the antivirus
- Enable the option showing the file extension. This will make it easier to locate files that hide malware. Some more "dangerous" extensions behind which viruses are hidden are ".exe, .vbs, .scr, .zip, .jar"
- In the event that you are affected by malware, immediately disconnect your computer from the network. This prevents the virus from spreading to colleagues' computers and, in the event that the ransomware has not yet been able to delete the encryption key, you can restore the files
