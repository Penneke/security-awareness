Does what you read seem incredible to you? Yet once started, a malware doesn't stop! Once it has infected the computer, it has the ability to self-replicate and propagate itself for the entire network to which it is connected; in addition to spreading on the web using the contact list of the compromised computer.

What would have happened if our heroine SiDi hadn't intervened in time?
Almost certainly Carla would have lost, irreversibly, all her data, and not having a recent backup of her computer, she could not have restored it to the state before the attack.

If the malware is actually a ransom-ware (ransom = ransom), it will try to "lock" all the files on the computer with an "unlock key" entered by the attacker who sent it. In this way, the criminal asks for money to provide the key and recover the user's locked files. In many cases this happens with a TIMER which at the expiry cancels and destroys everything!
